========
This is an R package for modeling bird movement.

Install by running on R:
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("Ctross/grackleator")
```

Some quick examples:

1) We use a small data-set from Monique Borgerhoff Mulder collected from Sukuma Men. 
```{r}
# Load library and attach data
library(grackleator)  
```
